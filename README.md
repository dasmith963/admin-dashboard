# admin-dashboard

This is my solution to the Odin Project's [Admin Dashboard](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard). 

## Overview
For this project I built an admin dashboard using CSS Grid to create the layout and align elements on the page. I decided to recreate the dashboard design from the design file linked below. 

Overall I am pleased with the way the site turned out. I still have much to learn, but I am comfortable using grid. I plan to revisit this project in the near future to make it more responsive for mobile users.
